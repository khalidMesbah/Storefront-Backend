        <h2>models</h2>
        <p>Models are a main component in our API</p>
        <p>the model file is defining what a book/user/product/order is for our application.</p>
        <p><mark>The model is represented as a class</mark>, each book row in the database will be an instance of the
            book model.</p>
        models are a class in our code that can be used as a template to create items that are stored as rows in the
        table.
        <p>The model is represented as a class, each book row in the database will be an instance of the book model.</p>
        <p> Models are a class representation of a table in the API</p>
        <p>A MODEL is the representation of a database table in an API.</p>
        <p>A table in a database can be represented in code as a class</p>
        <p>Each row can be an instance of this class</p>
        <p> Each instance of this class will become a new row in the database table.</p>

        <h2> Integration vs Unit Testing</h2>

        <p>A unit test, tests a small chunk of code in your application. Unit tests are for the individual functions or
            classes in your code, to make sure each one is doing what you need. These are small, typically fast to
            write,
            and can really save you time when trying to understand where a problem is happening in the program.</p>
        <p>An integration test checks how the individual pieces of your application logic work together. The span of one
            integration test will cover multiple chunks of code (that can and should each have their own unit tests) and
            make sure that working correctly together in a flow or process.</p>
        <p>I refer to the tests we wrote in this section as integration tests because they test a flow in the
            application
            from model to database and back. Its not a large process, so they won't look very different from unit tests,
            but
            it is a good opportunity to talk about the differences.</p>

        <q>A common pattern for organazing an API endpoints</q>
        <p>REST is useful for providing a predictable, industry standard, well-organized way to structure API endpoints.
        </p>
        <p>REST implies a specific set of API endpoints for every entity in the app</p>
        <p>There are five actionable RESTful routes for APIs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>INDEX</li>
            <li>SHOW</li>
            <li>CREATE</li>
            <li>EDIT</li>
            <li>DELETE</li>
        </ul>

        <p>CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing and is an important factor in making and handling API requests</p>
        <p>only found in browsers to make the web a safer place</p>
        <q>to make our api puclic to the universe</q>

                res.json({msg: 'This is CORS-enabled with a middle ware'})
