    <h2>models</h2>
    <p>
        Models are a main component in our API,
    </p>
    <h2> Integration vs Unit Testing</h2>

    <p>I touch on this topic in the video but it deserves a little more explanation. This isn't a course on testing so
        I'm not going too far into it, but understanding the main differences between these is important.</p>
    <p>A unit test, tests a small chunk of code in your application. Unit tests are for the individual functions or
        classes in your code, to make sure each one is doing what you need. These are small, typically fast to write,
        and can really save you time when trying to understand where a problem is happening in the program.</p>
    <p>An integration test checks how the individual pieces of your application logic work together. The span of one
        integration test will cover multiple chunks of code (that can and should each have their own unit tests) and
        make sure that working correctly together in a flow or process.</p>
    <p>I refer to the tests we wrote in this section as integration tests because they test a flow in the application
        from model to database and back. Its not a large process, so they won't look very different from unit tests, but
        it is a good opportunity to talk about the differences.</p>
    <blockquote>

        Migration - The record of a database schema change that also includes the logic to enact and rollback that
        change.
        Integration Test - Tests a flow or process in the application that spans multiple units of individual functions
        or classes.
